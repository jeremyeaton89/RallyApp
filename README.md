# RallyApp

This is my submission to the [Clean and Green Hackathon](http://cleanandgreenhackathon.com/developers/), hosted by Rally.org. 

**[See my App!](http://secret-tor-9770.herokuapp.com/)**

The idea behind this app is that a leaderboard might foster greater participation and a larger overall donation count, for causes that opt in. Any person with a valid Access Token and Rally Id can add a cause.

I gained exposure to several interesting Environmental APIs at this hackathon, including UC Berkeley's Cool Climate API. I will most definitely be playing with these APIs in the future!


## Features:
* Rally.org API
* Connect any Cause to this leaderboard app (with valid Access Token and Rally Id)

## ToDo:
* Donor show page
